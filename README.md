2.	The numbers representing on top of each category denotes the total sales made, while the numbers below denote the profits.
3.	Each of the profits is matched against a specific color to better visualize and understand at which quarter the profits were poor.

3.	This visual representation can tell us if a particular state is doing well in sales even though the
region that state belongs to isn’t doing well.
